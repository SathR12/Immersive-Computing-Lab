# Immersive-Computing-Lab
Scripts written during my time at the NYU ARISE Research Internship Immersive Computing Lab. Mainly for backup purposes.

## How to run 
Run the unity project and attempt to read the text using the Vive VR headset. After an adequate amount of time, exit play mode on Unity and then run main.py. This will dump all eye tracking and head tracking data into csv format and will create three scattergrams. The components of each Vector3 is graphed with respect to elapsed time to see spikes in graphs (value changes). 

## Python Dependencies 
- matplotlib
- csv
